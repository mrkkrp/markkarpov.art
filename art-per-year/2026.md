I've been slowly reframing my art is terms that perhaps relate better to
human condition.

I think the key theme I am treating (until recently it was happening largely
unconsciously) is what I call the ultimate terror of existence: to be put in
this universe as a link in a long chain of causes and effects without anyone
ever intending you and caring about you. All life simply follows its program
of survival, for survival is its only objective. Animals attack and fuck
each other because they do not have much of a choice. Humans, it would seem,
could do better in terms of caring, but they don't. We are in a bleak world
of empty noise of social media, toxic ambitions, consumerism, and now we are
turning increasingly towards fascism.

It would seem that one function of religion was to alleviate the ultimate
terror of existence, but religion in our day and age is a voluntary
delusion.

(This is different from the so-called “existential terror”. I don't mind
mortality and I don't find life meaningless.)

My subject is *nature morte par excellence*. What can be more dead than a
corner or a pile of rags? Looking at inanimate nature is both comforting and
terrifying. Comforting because it is reliable—there is no surprises or
betrayals, terrifying because it reminds me that the whole world is in
essence just as dead.

All paintings from 2025 were done from photographs. At first I was almost
ashamed to have done them that way, but now I realize that I work best this
way.

The constraints I imposed:

* Only one painting can be made from one given photograph
* It has to be made within a week from the time the photograph was made,
  otherwise the photo becomes too old and I lose the right to paint from it
* The painting should be done in a single session, alla prima, 3 hours
  maximum

I noticed that the environment looks more fresh if it is presented in an
unusual way, e.g.:

* Extreme focal length (especially very wide shots)
* Photos taken from far away, e.g. aerial photography with a drone (only one
  painting in 2025 was done from a drone photo, but I can expect that this
  method will give more in time)
* Macro-photos is an exciting new method I am going to try to paint from
  this year.

A new topic: table and plates after the food has been eaten. It is
interesting, because by default it seems like this is not something we want
to look at, however it is revealing about our most basic nature, what
suspends us in the environment we experience, what we have to do in order to
survive—which was kind of the main topic of my art in 2025. 2025 was about
seeing what makes things work, “looking under the hood” of arrangements that
people make, how things really work. Concentrating on dirty dishes is a
continuation of that topic.

Bigger canvases.
