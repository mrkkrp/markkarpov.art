Talk about the main idea behind my art up to this point—presence in reality
or environment. By “presence” I mean a very particular thing, the feeling of
continuity, of being suspended in reality, of being present, directly
connected to the things that surround us (better description needed). This
is a special, meditative kind of feeling that I try to hint at in my works.

All paintings from 2025 were done from photographs. At first I was almost
ashamed to have done them that way, but now I realize that I work best this
way.

The constraints I imposed:

* Only one painting can be made from one given photograph
* It has to be made within a week from the time the photograph was made,
  otherwise the photo becomes too old and I lose the right to paint from it
* The painting should be done in a single session, alla prima, 3 hours
  maximum

I noticed that the environment looks more fresh if it is presented in an
unusual way, e.g.:

* Extreme focal length (especially very wide shots)
* Photos taken from far away, e.g. aerial photography with a drone (only one
  painting in 2025 was done from a drone photo, but I can expect that this
  method will give more in time)
* Macro-photos is an exciting new method I am going to try to paint from
  this year.

A new topic: table and plates after the food has been eaten. It is
interesting, because by default it seems like this is not something we want
to look at, however it is revealing about our most basic nature, what
suspends us in the environment we experience, what we have to do in order to
survive—which was kind of the main topic of my art in 2025. 2025 was about
seeing what makes things work, “looking under the hood” of arrangements that
people make, how things really work. Concentrating on dirty dishes is a
continuation of that topic.

Bigger canvases.
