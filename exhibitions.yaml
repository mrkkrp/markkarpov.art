    For Salon d'Automne this autumn I decided to send one of the [real
    realist](/essay/real-realism.html) paintings I made last year. Even
    though real realism is not something I still develop these days (in
    2024), it seemed to me that if I were to expose one single painting, I
    had to start with my real realist works.
