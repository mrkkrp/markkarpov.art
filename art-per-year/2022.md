It is probably fair to say that 2022 is the year of my birth as a visual
artist. Even though I started painting somewhat earlier, in March 2021, my
output that year was mostly derivative and is of little interest. In 2022 I
moved from Paris to Château-Thierry—a place that is much closer to the
countryside and therefore more encouraging for original landscape work. My
goals that year were modest:

* Get started with oils. Before I painted only in watercolors.
* Achieve authenticity and establish unity of life and art through painting
  things that surround me.
* Improve my drawing skills.

2022 was the year of numerous stylistic experiments, most of which I
destroyed or painted over. As a (mostly) landscape painter at the time, I
started from what I saw around me and then considered questions such as:

* Should I change the colors and if yes, how?
* Should I change the shapes and if yes, how?
* Should I change the texture of this or that area?
* Etc.

At first I would often give in to the temptation, but I always found that
any deviation from reality was inferior to it, even when such deviations
were tried and true and approved by the masters. The problem was this. An
intentional deviation from reality (as perceived by the artist) means that
the artist has a notion of artistic value that is different from
reproduction of observable reality. This notion of artistic value is
arbitrary unless it is justified [1](footnote:1). Arbitrary art is not good
art. At the same time it was hard for me to justify any deviation from
observable reality whatsoever because reality actually exists and in that
sense it is *true*, while everything else is at best *beautiful*. It appears
preferable to identify artistic value with truth rather than beauty because
truth is absolute and is not subject to devaluation or change. Granted, this
conclusion seemed disappointing from the point of view of artistic
originality, but at least there were no philosophical problems with it.

At first I worked mostly from photographs and it wasn't until late November
that I ventured for *plein air* oil painting which immediately proved not as
difficult as I imagined (except on colder days) and very rewarding.

Finally, one approach I was playing with that year is *direct painting*,
that is, painting right away without any sketches and starting from the
parts that attract most attention instead of following “the rules of the
medium”. This gradually developed into the idea that the way painting is
done is just as important as the end result. After a while I put this
approach on hold since it was much more difficult and required a lot of
concentration. In [2023](/art/2023.html) I returned to the idea of direct
painting and integrated it into [real realism](/essay/real-realism.html).

  1. While this is an accurate account of my thinking at the time, as of
     January 2024 I'm reconsidering this stance. The ability to perform
     arbitrary choices must be predicated on the existence of free will. I
     currently do not think there is such a thing as free will, therefore it
     must be the case that the notion of artistic value of a particular
     artist is never arbitrary. It is determined completely by the sum of
     influences of the world on the artist. Thus, the artist themselves as
     well as whatever mental activity they may have is part of reality and
     therefore true.
