It is probably fair to say that 2022 is the year of my birth as a visual
artist. Even though I started painting somewhat earlier, in March 2021, my
output that year was mostly derivative and is of little interest. In 2022 I
moved from Paris to Château-Thierry—a place that is closer to the
countryside and therefore more encouraging for original landscape work. My
goals that year were modest:

* Get started with oils. Before I painted only in watercolors.
* Achieve authenticity and establish unity of life and art through painting
  things that surround me.
* Improve my drawing skills.

2022 was the year of numerous stylistic experiments, most of which I
destroyed or painted over. As a (mostly) landscape painter at the time, I
started from what I saw around me and then considered questions such as:

* Should I change the colors and if yes, how?
* Should I change the shapes and if yes, how?
* Should I change the texture of this or that area?
* Etc.

At first I would often give in to the temptation, but I always found that
any deviation from reality was inferior to it, even when such deviations
were tried and true and approved by the masters. The problem was this. An
intentional deviation from reality (as perceived by the artist) means that
the artist has a notion of artistic value that is different from accurate
depiction of observable reality. What should that notion be? How can it be
defined and defended? It seems that at least with accurate depiction of
reality one cannot go wrong because reality actually exists and in that
sense its depiction is [*true*][correspondence-theory-of-truth], while
everything else is at best *beautiful*. It appears preferable to identify
artistic value with truth rather than beauty because truth is absolute and
is not subject to devaluation or change. Besides, given the events in the
world that year, it felt shameful to search for beauty when truth was in
trouble.

Such aspirations for objectivity seemed at first appealing, but that was
illusory for there cannot be a work of art without artistic decisions (e.g.
as basic as the choice of subject or angle of view) and those cannot be
objective and impartial[1](footnote:1).

At first I worked mostly from photographs and it wasn't until late November
that I ventured for *plein air* oil painting which immediately proved not as
difficult as I imagined (except on colder days) and very rewarding.

Finally, one approach I was playing with that year is *direct painting*,
that is, painting right away without any sketches and starting from the
parts that attract most attention instead of following “the rules of the
medium”. This gradually developed into the idea that the way painting is
done is just as important as the end result. After a while I put this
approach on hold since it was much more difficult and required a lot of
concentration. In [2023](/art/2023.html) I returned to the idea of direct
painting and integrated it into [real realism](/essay/real-realism.html).

  1. What would the word “objective” mean when applied to the choice of
     subject for an artwork? Would artworks that cover a diverse range of
     subjects be more objective than artworks that deal only with one
     specific kind of subject? Would angles of view or moments of time that
     demonstrate a thing in a clear and unambiguous way be more objective
     than others that conceal some features or aspects of the depicted
     thing?
