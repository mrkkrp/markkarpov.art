    For the Salon d'Automne this autumn I decided to send one of the [real
    realist](/essay/real-realism.html) paintings I made last year. Even
    though real realism is not something I still develop these days (in
    2024), it seemed to me that if I were to expose one single painting, I
    had to start with my real realist works.

    I am happy to be able to expose a recent work in this year's Salon
    d'Automne in Paris. Compared to the last year, my subject remains the
    same—presence in “reality”, or, if the word “reality” is too overloaded,
    presence in the physical environment that surrounds us, as well as a
    particular brand of anti-escapism. However, the means of conveying my
    message have been updated—now it is done primarily through the choice of
    subject, whereas in the work I presented last year it was done through
    framing. I hope that no explanation is needed to be able to appreciate
    this work.

    Watercolor was the first medium I tried and it is still the trickiest to
    tame—that is to say that I am not so confident about this submission.
    Artists who have not exposed here before are supposed to send 5
    candidate paintings, from which one will be chosen by the jury of the
    salon. When it was time to apply I realized that I did not have 5
    watercolors that I was absolutely proud of, so I took (25.05.2025) and
    painted 4 more in the period between 19.08.2025 and 22.08.2025—one
    watercolor per day. I have to say the jury chose the most
    traditional-looking one and perhaps not the one I would choose myself
    (my preference would be 19.08.2025 or 21.08.2025). Nevertheless, I am
    happy to be represented.

    The Salon des Artistes Français that takes place as part of the big
    exhibition “Art Capital” in Grand Palais happens to be the first
    occasion for me to expose a landscape painting in oils. I am quite
    pleased with this painting of Château-Thierry in March and I find that
    it is a suitable sample of my work from 2025.
