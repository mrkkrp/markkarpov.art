    For Salon d'Automne this autumn I decided to send one of the [real
    realist](/essay/real-realism.html) paintings I made last year. Even
    though real realism is not something I still develop these days (in
    2024), it seemed to me that if I were to expose one single painting, I
    had to start with my real realist works.

    I am happy to be able to expose a recent work in this year's Salon
    d'Automne in Paris. Compared to the last year, my subject remains the
    same—presence in “reality”, or, if the word “reality” is too overloaded,
    presence in the physical environment that surrounds us, as well as a
    particular brand of anti-escapism. However, the means of conveying my
    message have been updated—now it is done primarily through the choice of
    subject, whereas in the work I presented last year it was done through
    framing. I hope that no explanation is needed to be able to appreciate
    this work.
