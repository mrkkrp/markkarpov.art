This year has been marked by disillusionment with respect to real realism in
its pure form. There are two main reasons for this and correspondingly two
distinct directions for making progress:

* Painting is not an adequate method for implementing the real realist
  intention for reasons that I will explain in an upcoming essay. The
  solution is to work on a completely different approach which has little to
  do with art (as it is usually understood). I call this approach
  *perception routines*. This is something that I am still actively working
  on and it may take a while till I publish a comprehensive account on the
  subject.
* Spring finally came and it became difficult to keep painting purely real
  realist works that aim to make a certain point. Instead, I found myself
  painting a more traditional kind of landscapes and enjoying nature.
  Besides, making a point with art by the virtue of doing something not
  entirely common became almost an intention of its own, and a trivial one
  at that, since most artists strive to make something that “stands out”. My
  attitude to this was to relax and enjoy spring. Another development was
  that I shifted my attention from painting to photography. It is not clear
  yet what to do with my growing collection of photos.
